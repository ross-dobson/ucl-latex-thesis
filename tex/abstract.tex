    This is a \LaTeX\ template for writing scientific theses. Ross Dobson created it because he was fed up of using various ancient templates that were 99\% broken full of commands that noone understood. No longer will you spend your valuable science time on just trying to get Overleaf to compile your document successfully. Last updated March 16th 2021.
