These first free columns are using `justified' text. That works in the main body, but in tables, it looks bad.&This is because rather than specifying the alignment with \texttt{c, l, r}, we have specified a fixed width for the column with \verb|{p{3cm}}|.&Justified text works nicely in the main body, but in tables, it looks bad.&These last three columns are using right aligned text. Notice it looks better.&The command to do this is \verb|>{\raggedright}|, put before the column width specifier \verb|p{3cm}|.&However, the final \emph{column} needs \verb|\arraybackslash| after the \verb|\raggedright|, inside the same set of curly brackets \verb|{}|. Finally, rather than \verb|\\| at the end of the row, the final \emph{row} of the table needs \verb|\tabularnewline| instead. \tabularnewline
